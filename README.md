# Simon-Says-Game
creation: a color-based Simon Says game!      I Just built it just using     HTML        : Structuring the game's core  elements and layout.    CSS           : Bringing the design with dynamic color changes and smooth                                                          transitions    JavaScript : This was where the real logic lived.
